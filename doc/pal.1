.TH pal 1 "9 Nov 2012" "version 0.2"
.SH NAME
pal \- complies programs for the PAL language; a subset of Pascal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pal [\-Snac] [
.I filename
.B ].pal

.SH DESCRIPTION
When you invoke PAL, the PAL compiler translates PAL source code into ASC assembler code and invokes the ASC interpreter to execute it. Passing optional arguments to PAL can provide valuable debugging feedback, for example.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -S
Leave ASC code in [
.I filename
].asc instead of removing it
.TP
.B -n
Do not produce program listing. (Default is to produce one)
.TP
.B -a
Do not generate run-time array subscripts bounds checking. (Default is to do so)
.TP
.B -c
Compiles program into ASC code, but does not execute it.

.SH BUGS
This is the initial framework for a compiler, so no machine/assembler code is generated by this compiler as of this version. Comments that appear at the start of the file will be numbered as a single line in the program listing.
