Known Issues:

Newlines within a string that are not escaped will screw up the line number 
count.

Calling chr () on 255 and greater will cause undefined behaviour, specific to the implementation of C
on the machine (eg little endian or big endian integer representation)


Array accesses and assignments for multidimensional arrays is implemented non-deterministically.

Runtime Array bounds checking is not implemented.  Thus, the -a flag does not serve any purpose


pred and succ will always just return a value. They do not check if the pred or succ is out of bounds
